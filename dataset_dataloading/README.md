- Validation and testing set are collected from 2,000 source videos which do not appear in any training set to avoid testing information leakage. For each source video, we randomly sample 3 clips.
- Training set (10M) is the high-quality subset of training set (full). In the subset, we only sample at most 3 clips from a source video to increase diversity and the video-caption matching scores are all larger than 0.43 to guarantee a better caption quality.
- Training set (2M) is randomly sampled from training set (10M) and include 3 clips for each source video.
- **[Note 1]** The training csv files are too large and are compressed into zip files. Please `unzip` to get the csv files.
- **[Note 2]** We will remove the video samples from our dataset as long as you need it. Please contact tsaishienchen at gmail dot com for the request.
 
## Download Dataset
### Setup Repository and Enviroment
```
git clone https://github.com/tsaishien-chen/Panda-70M.git
cd Panda-70M/dataset_dataloading/video2dataset
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

### Download Dataset
Download the csv files and change `<csv_file>` and `<output_folder>` arguments to download corresponding data.
```
video2dataset --url_list="<csv_file>" \
              --url_col="url" \
              --caption_col="caption" \
              --clip_col="timestamp" \
              --output_folder="<output_folder>" \
              --save_additional_columns="[matching_score]" \
              --config="video2dataset/video2dataset/configs/panda_70M.yaml"
```
- **[Note]** If you get `HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` error, it might because your IP got banned. Please refer [this issue](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/8785) and try to download the data by another IP.

### Dataset Format
The code will download and store the data with the format:
```
output-folder
 ├── 00000 {shardID}
 |     ├── 0000000_00000.mp4 {shardID + videoID _ clipID}
 |     ├── 0000000_00000.txt
 |     ├── 0000000_00000.json
 |     ├── 0000000_00001.mp4
 |     ├── 0000000_00001.txt
 |     ├── 0000000_00001.json
 |     └── ...
 |     ├── 0000099_00004.mp4
 |     ├── 0000099_00004.txt
 |     ├── 0000099_00004.json
 ├── 00001
 |     ├── 0000100_00000.mp4
 |     ├── 0000100_00000.txt
 |     ├── 0000100_00000.json
 │     ...
 ...
```
- Each data comes with 3 files: `.mp4` (video), `.txt` (caption), `.json` (meta information)
- Meta information includes matching score (confidence score of each video-caption pair), caption, video title / description / categories / subtitles, to name but a few.
- **[Note 1]** The dataset is unshuffled and the clips from a same long video would be stored into a shard. Please manually shuffle them if needed.
- **[Note 2]** The videos are resized into 360 px height. You can change `download_size` in the [config](./video2dataset/video2dataset/configs/panda_70M.yaml) file to get different video resolutions.
